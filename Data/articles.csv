4.22.2020,Missouri is suing China over coronavirus impacts saying the country did 'little to stop the spread of the disease,"(CNN) — Missouri is suing the Chinese government and other top institutions for the role they played in the coronavirus pandemic and the effects it has had on the state, accusing the country of covering up information, silencing whistleblowers and doing little to stop the spread of the disease, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt announced Tuesday. At least 6,105 people have been confirmed to have the virus in Missouri and at least 229 have died, according to numbers from Johns Hopkins University.
Schmitt, in his official role as attorney general of Missouri, filed the civil lawsuit in federal court in the eastern district of Missouri.
The lawsuit, the first of its kind, claims ""Chinese authorities deceived the public, suppressed crucial information, arrested whistleblowers, denied human-to-human transmission in the face of mounting evidence, destroyed critical medical research, permitted millions of people to be exposed to the virus, and even hoarded personal protective equipment—thus causing a global pandemic that was unnecessary and preventable.""
Legal experts have said the lawsuit faces an uphill battle because China is protected by sovereign immunity. CNN is reaching out to the Chinese government for comment.
Missouri's lawsuit alleges that while the Chinese medical community had indications of human-to-human transmission of the virus, they did not inform the World Health Organization when they first reported the outbreak.
It also alleges Chinese leaders did little to curb spread of the virus, still allowing thousands of people to travel to and out of Wuhan.
In mid-January, on or around January 16, despite knowing the risks of doing so, Wuhan leaders hosted a potluck dinner for 40,000 residents, increasing the potential spread of the virus, it says. ""Defendants allowed these massive public gatherings and massive exodus from Wuhan despite knowing the risks of COVID-19, including the risk of human-to-human transmission.""
The filing also outlines how officials initially cracked down on medical professionals who posted information about the virus, including Dr. Li Wenliang, who was accused of rumor-mongering by the Wuhan police after sharing information about a new illness with his medical school alumni group. Wenliang later died of the virus.
The state also alleges China hoarded PPE while concealing the outbreak and that the small amounts they have released have been ""faulty.""
Those, among other actions taken by Chinese officials had a massive toll on human life and health and has led to ""enormous"" economic disruptions across the world, according to the lawsuit.
Before the pandemic, Missouri had one of its lowest unemployment rates of the past decade, but on information and belief, Missouri's unemployment rate is now the highest it has been since the Great Depression, the suit claims. ""Responding to the pandemic has required shutting down businesses, disrupting ordinary production and trade, and dislocating workers.""

4.22.2020,Missouri sues Chinese government over virus handling,"The US state of Missouri is suing the Chinese government over its handling of the coronavirus which it says has led to severe economic losses. In the lawsuit, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt alleges China did little to stop the spread of the virus.
Mr Schmitt claims Missouri residents have suffered possibly tens of billions of dollars in economic damages.
But legal experts doubt how far the state will get with the legal action, and the motivation behind it.
In Missouri, the impact of the virus is very real - thousands have been infected and many have died, families have been separated from dying loved ones, small businesses are shuttering their doors, and those living paycheck to paycheck are struggling to put food on their table, Mr Schmitt said in a statement.
The Chinese government lied to the world about the danger and contagious nature of COVID-19, silenced whistleblowers, and did little to stop the spread of the disease, Mr Schmitt said. ""They must be held accountable for their actions.""

The civil lawsuit, filed on Tuesday, is against the Chinese government, Chinese Communist Party and other Chinese officials and institutions.
Legal experts have questioned the move and how far it will get. A legal doctrine called sovereign immunity offers foreign governments broad protection from being sued in US courts.

Crowds pack Plum Island during coronavirus pandemic

According to Boston’s WFXT, Newbury police Chief Michael Reilley was disappointed by the crowds at Plum Island beach.
“It really wasn’t even that great of a beach day,” said Reilly. “But it was a beautiful sunny day, and it was pandemonium.”
>> Coronavirus symptoms: What you need to know
He said cars were parked all along Plum Island Turnpike, and many of them were from out of state. Police say too many people were not social distancing, while Massachusetts is in the middle of a surge in COVID-19 cases.
“My officers described it as busy as a Fourth of July weekend in 90-degree weather,” said Reilly. “It was extremely busy.”
Right now, police said only permit parking is permitted on Plum Island, but hundreds ignored that Sunday.
>> Coronavirus: Know the facts directly from the CDC
“They were like tailgate parties, and they would be carrying their beach furniture with them instead of taking a walk to use the beach like Gov. Baker suggested, in a transient fashion, taking a walk or jog or exercise. ...They were making a day of it,” said Reilly.
So now, Newbury town leaders are getting aggressive with their parking restrictions to prevent gatherings on the beach during this pandemic. They closed all parking lots to the public and will start ticketing and towing those who come to Plum Island while a stay-at-home advisory is in effect.
>> Coronavirus: Can the government make you stay home if you are sick?
“It’s a $50 parking ticket, and then your car won’t be there when you get off the beach because it will be towed,” said Reilly.
Reilly said that if people don’t obey these rules, officials will be forced to close down the beach completely, but he hopes if everyone continues to social distance, there’s still a chance people can enjoy the summer there.
“If we’re disciplined and aggressive now, hopefully that will pay dividends a month from now, and we’ll get back to a normal life,” said Reilly. “That’s what we’re hoping for.”",

4.22.2020,World experts speculate real coronavirus figures multiple times official numbers,"TOKYO -- As the number of novel coronavirus cases keeps rising in Japan and many parts of the world, experts from here and abroad are calling the officially announced number of infections into question, suspecting that there may be even more virus carriers in reality. 【Related】WHO warns rush to ease virus rules could cause resurgence
Related New wave of infections threatens to collapse Japan hospitals
Related Global coronavirus infections top 2 million, most in Europe, US
As of now, more than 10,000 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in Japan, while the figure stands over 2.5 million worldwide. However, some experts estimate that there were already tens of millions of cases across the globe. Behind the conjecture lies the fact that many of those who contract the novel virus strain show no symptoms and that there is a limit to the amount of testing that can be conducted on suspected cases.
In early April, a research team at the University of Gottingen in Germany released a staggering estimate that as of the end of March 2020 there should have been tens of millions of coronavirus infections around the world.
According to a tally by Johns Hopkins University in the United States, the number of coronavirus cases in the world initially was somewhere around 860,000. Yet when the institution calculated potential numbers of infected individuals by using the fatality rate of coronavirus cases based on a large-scale survey in China as well as the number of deaths in many countries, the estimated number of infections in Italy came to around 3.02 million -- about 28 times the officially confirmed cases of roughly 106,000 at the end of March.
The same study speculated that Spain actually had some 5.72 million coronavirus cases -- 60 times the publicly confirmed 96,000 cases -- and that the U.S. had approximately 11.85 million cases -- 63 times the ascertained 190,000 cases. The Baltimore-based university similarly presumed that Japan actually had some 7,800 cases, four times the 2,000 cases that had been confirmed by that time.
Experts in other countries are also voicing similar suspicions. According to an April 3 report by Reuters, Brendan Murphy, chief medical officer of Australia, stated that the global number of coronavirus cases had likely reached between 5 million and 10 million. Britain's Imperial College London released an estimate that by March 28, some 7 million to 43 million people had been infected with the novel coronavirus in 11 European countries.
Dr. Yasuharu Tokuda, head of the Muribushi Project for Okinawa Residency Programs based in Japan's southernmost prefecture of Okinawa and an expert in clinical epidemiology, commented, ""It is likely that the number of infected people is 12 times the officially announced figures (in Japan)."" He surmised the figure based on the possibility that some people do not test positive for the virus even though they are infected, as well as the ratio of people with no symptoms or only mild symptoms less than four days after becoming infected who haven't been tested.
Considering there are emerging countries where the testing systems aren't well organized, it is estimated that the global number of infections is at least 10 times the released figures, Tokuda said.
Because individuals with mild symptoms, who account for the majority of the cases, are not isolated, they end up spreading the virus. In order to prevent medical systems from falling apart, it is essential to test people at high risk of infection right away and contain virus transmissions by tracking down infection routes and isolating close contacts, he said.

As the coronavirus pandemic has spread, terrorist groups have reacted in different ways.
Traditional terrorist groups such as the Islamic State and al Qaeda and its many affiliates are for the most part confused in their response to COVID-19. Some see chaos that they can take advantage of (in places such as West Africa), others divine retribution on nonbelievers (as the Islamic State and the Turkistan Islamic Party, a Uighur group, have suggested), while others an opportunity to show their governance capabilities (such as the Taliban and Hezbollah). Governments have redeployed some counterterrorism capabilities to support the coronavirus response while contorting legal definitions of terrorism to prosecute people committing antisocial acts such as coughing on others.

So far, the number of acts that could reasonably be called terrorism have been quite limited. It is for the most part generic anti-establishmentarianism fed by conspiracy theories. Fear of 5G technology being linked to the spread of the disease has led to the burnings of cell-phone towers across Europe.
In the United States, fear of big government has resulted in a bomb plan targeting a Kansas City, Kansas, hospital preparing for virus response and an attempt to derail a train in the Port of Los Angeles shipyard. Some more enterprising jihadis have sought to weaponize the coronavirus, while the extreme right wing has largely only talked about doing it.
These acts have a unifying theme. Like most terrorism, they are fundamentally acts of revolt against the established order. In the United States there is a rich tradition of anti-government activity, drawing on a broader narrative of libertarianism than runs through the American body politic.In the United States there is a rich tradition of anti-government activity, drawing on a broader narrative of libertarianism than runs through the American body politic.
Oklahoma City just marked the 25th anniversary of Timothy McVeigh’s attack on the Alfred P. Murrah building in 1995 that led to 168 deaths. McVeigh emerged from a broader U.S. movement called “Patriots” by federal investigators, who had long worried about these extreme libertarians’ potential for violence and their propensity for gathering lots of weapons. More recently, this movement has expressed itself through sovereign citizen groups, which reject federal regulations and target police.
For those whose mindset is shaped by this history of anti-government activity, the massive expansion of the state that follows a national crisis like a pandemic outbreak will be a concern. For such individuals, the fear is as much about expansion of the state as it is distrust in government’s activity in general. Some expressions of this anger are already visible in places such as Michigan, Kentucky, and North Carolina.
This sense of disenfranchisement is further exacerbated thanks to the growing distrust that is visible in government globally. Given the propensity of leaders to publicly utter untruths or half-truths, citizens’ collective faith in government is being eroded. Various criminal organizations have spotted this and sought to offer themselves as alternatives.
Terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, the Taliban, and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham that control pieces of territory have used the chaos to showcase their own public health capabilities, as thin as they are. Criminal groups in Brazil, El Salvador, and Mexico are seeking to display their power and resources. These moves are not particularly altruistic, however, with most groups undertaking them out of recognition of the battle for hearts and minds they could win through these acts.
Others on the fringes are taking this distrust to its violent extreme, and their number is likely to increase over time. The current COVID-19 response is going to expand the presence of the state, draw attention to inequalities that will be exacerbated in the post-coronavirus economy, and ultimately highlight the budget-tightening that is going to have to follow.The current COVID-19 response is going to expand the presence of the state, draw attention to inequalities that will be exacerbated in the post-coronavirus economy, and ultimately highlight the budget-tightening that is going to have to follow. Some may fear big government, but others will instead grow angry if it is not seen to be dealing with their problems and concerns. These fissures all open up narratives ripe for exploitation by anti-government factions, racist groups, political extremists of every type, and extremist Luddites or other fringe groups.
The growing army of the disenfranchised will create a community of those who are open to placing the blame on someone else. In the West there has been a growing push to blame China—something that is happening among senior officials (such as Deputy National Security Advisor Matthew Pottinger and Sen. Ted Cruz in the United States or the heads of the parliamentary defense and foreign select committees in the U.K.) and increasingly in the general population in countries where the tone of anti-Chinese sentiment is growing. This anger is also straining existing social tensions around migrants, something visible in the nasty racist tinge that colors a lot of COVID-19 discourse.

Unfortunately, once anti-Chinese sentiment catches on among the general public, it tends to be less discerning—resulting in abuse and violence toward all those who appear to be of East Asian ethnicity. And while hate crimes do not always equate to terrorism, they are often a precursor to it. The intercommunal tensions hate crimes produce provide fodder to those who are prone to violence to act out on their nasty impulses, as well as providing a rich environment for groups seeking to advance divisive ideologies.
Once anti-Chinese sentiment catches on among the general public, it results in abuse and violence toward all those who appear to be of East Asian ethnicity.
This problem is not exclusive to the West. In Indonesia, researchers have warned of a growing tension toward Chinese nationals within the country. This draws on a rich seam of anger toward China more generally in the country—in part stemming from historical ethnic tensions, but more recently being exacerbated by Beijing’s treatment of its Muslim Uighur minority. There have even been warnings of this sentiment resulting in terrorism against Chinese residents of Indonesia, with a cell reported as having discussed targeting Chinese workers. This might lay the foundations for a more violent expression of anti-Chinese terrorism in Southeast Asia.
Chinese relations with Southeast Asia are often strained, and there are other expressions of anger against China more generally at the moment as well. Thailand became embroiled in an online spat with China when young Thais took umbrage at Chinese online warriors attacking prominent Thai actors for expressing views in solidarity with Taiwan and Hong Kong. The resulting “milk tea alliance”—so called because people in the countries are generally fans of sweet milk tea—has angered Beijing and dragged in the local embassy to express the usual Chinese anger at others recognizing the independence of places Beijing sees as part of China.
In Kazakhstan, a post on the Chinese internet that appeared to suggest that Kazakhstan wanted to become part of China drew enough ire to prompt the Kazakh Ministry of Foreign Affairs to haul in the Chinese ambassador and demand an apology. In neighboring Kyrgyzstan, anti-Chinese sentiment coalesced around the idea of Chinese nationals being spreaders of the disease and has seen a member of parliament make statements about how Chinese citizens should be avoided.
None of this is terrorism, of course, but there is a clearer focus of public anger toward China. As China becomes a more dominant player in world affairs, it will increasingly become a targetAs China becomes a more dominant player in world affairs, it will increasingly become a target, something that is in part driven by Beijing’s treatment of minorities at home. This could crystallize into attacks on Chinese nationals or companies.
At the even darker fringes, even the 5G telephone pole-burning phenomenon might be a prelude to something else. The Luddites were a group of textile workers in the U.K. who emerged in the 19th centur. They were known for violently protesting as technology developed that was slowly displacing their jobs. In more modern times, Ted Kaczynski, better known as the Unabomber, carried forward the Luddite mantle by leading an almost two-decade-long bombing campaign that culminated in the publication of his manifesto, “Industrial Society and Its Future”—a screed about how modern technology was eroding personal freedoms.
Today, the rapid shift to online work by a growing proportion of workers is going to dramatically accelerate in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Companies are shrinking volumes of staff and trying to work more online or remotely. Things that were previously done in person are now migrating online.
Having been made redundant by online tools, disgruntled ex-workers could very well repurpose them to mobilize a backlash.
While many will return to working in the ways they did before the crisis, a surprisingly high number might find their work pattern permanently altered or face redundancy as a result of the cost savings that companies now see they can make while still achieving the same result. This might create an angry movement that draws together disgruntled ex-workers using the very tools that they are angry about for displacing them. Having been made redundant by online tools, they could very well repurpose them to mobilize a backlash.
Terrorism often emerges in the spaces where government is perceived to have failed or where people feel they are being excluded from the system. The pandemic is likely to lower people’s sense of trust in authority even further. The result will be increased problems from those who turn angry enough to want to use violence to articulate their grievances.
The world has already seen a failure in international cooperation when it comes to responding to the coronavirus, and while there have been innumerable acts of kindness between citizens, the larger sense of anger and disenfranchisement that will follow will create new forms of political violence. Some will draw on long-standing ideologies and groups, while others will emerge in surprising ways. Terrorism will not end in the wake of the coronavirus; instead, it is likely to evolve in ever more extreme ways.",https://archive.vn/i7eir#selection-829.0-1737.511

4.22.2020,US could see a higher summer death toll and CDC warns of a possibly worse coronavirus outbreak in winter,"CDC director says possible second wave could be worse 02:52
(CNN) — A leading US model has upped its projected coronavirus death toll in August to 66,000 -- a 10% increase from its previous prediction.
The change came as states began updating their number of deaths, adding residents of nursing homes who officials are now counting as presumptive positives, Dr. Chris Murray, the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, said Tuesday.
But as those numbers grow higher and paint the pandemic as larger than previously thought, Murray said the dates of when social distancing measures can be relaxed should also be moved down.
He said his team of experts were taken aback when states like Georgia -- which still has a high number of infections -- announced they'll be easing some restrictions. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has said he expects an uptick in cases as many stores begin to reopen in the state this Friday, but said the state is prepared to handle them.

""If people start to go back to normal social interaction or even progressively go back, the risk of transmission will go up ... and then you go back to the sort of exponential rise that was happening before we put in social distancing,"" Murray told CNN.

Your coronavirus questions, answered
California town one of the first to try to test all its residents
To safely move forward, experts have long emphasized the country should be able to track, trace and isolate cases.
Bolinas, a remote Northern California community, may be one of the first in the world to attempt to test all of its residents for the virus and for the antibodies that may make people immune.

Less than 2,000 people live in the town and in the first two days of testing, more than 700 residents showed up. The community-wide free testing is voluntary and part of a new study launched by the University of California, San Francisco, that's attempting to get a more complete understanding of how the virus is invisibly spreading.
That unseen spread is something health officials all over the state are trying to tackle, now recommending coronavirus testing for asymptomatic people who live or work in high-risk environments such as nursing homes or hospitals.

The new guidelines, from the state's department of health, were announced in an April 19 memo and make California the first state in the nation to broaden its guidelines for testing to include those without symptoms, state health officials told CNN.
According to a spokesperson from the department, the previous guidance from the CDC was to test high-risk patients with symptoms and healthcare workers with symptoms.
Meanwhile, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Tuesday the state is currently averaging 14,500 coronavirus tests a day.
That number, he said, ""is still inadequate"" and the state has a long way to go before attempting to reopen.
The US has so far conducted 4 million tests
In two different plans for reopening society, economists and public health experts have said millions of tests should be conducted each week before restrictions can be lifted.
One report estimates three to 30 million tests should be conducted weekly, while the other says the US should be conducting 20 million tests each day to get a handle on the pandemic.

So far, the country has performed about 4 million tests. And while federal officials tout the country has testing capacity, some state leaders -- including Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker -- have reported that while they may have the necessary machines, they're lacking the materials and staff to run them.
A new test that was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration may mean Americans can mail in their results. The test would allow patients to collect their samples using an at-home test kit and then mail it into the lab for testing, the FDA said Tuesday.
That test could be available in most states to consumers who have a doctor's order within the coming weeks, the agency said.
""Throughout this pandemic we have been facilitating test development to ensure patients access to accurate diagnostics, which includes supporting the development of reliable and accurate at-home sample collection options,"" FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said in the agency's announcement.

The news comes as an announcement from another company warned of possibly misleading results.
Abbott Laboratories, the maker of a rapid coronavirus test that's been widely used across the country and distributed by the federal government, warned its device can produce false negatives if a certain solution is used to move or store the patients' samples.
The company told health care workers not to use ""viral transport media"" solutions on its device and instead said customers should only place swabs with patients' samples directly in the device.
States are grappling with how to move forward
Despite the questions still surrounding tests in the US, many governors across the country have turned their attention to reopening their state's economy.
Last week, the federal government said in order to do so, states should wait to see a 14-day continuous decline before thinking about lifting their measures -- the first of three phases of reopening.

Georgia's governor said workers and business owners need relief, adding that businesses including bowling alleys, body art studios and hair and nail salons can reopen this week. Theaters and restaurants can open their doors next week with social distancing restrictions.
Kemp said that no local ordinance can restrict the openings, which will be implemented statewide. Mayors across the state were left astounded, many saying they're unprepared for such a move.
Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told CNN Tuesday she's exploring whether the city has legal grounds for putting different orders in place than what Kemp has announced.

In Tennessee, Gov. Bill Lee announced most businesses across the state will be able to reopen May 1, once the state's stay-at-home order has expired -- but hinted some may be able to open even sooner.
Other governors -- including New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Newsom -- have announced they have partnered with neighboring states to come up with plans to reopen but have stopped short of giving a timeline just yet. Cuomo has highlighted that ramped up testing will be key in preparing the state.
On Tuesday, he tweeted the state was planning to double its capacity to 40,000 tests per day, saying it was an ""ambitious"" goal but ""critical.""

4.22.2020,People are dying from coronavirus because we’re not fast enough at clinical research,"When medical historians look back at the Covid-19 pandemic, they will reckon with how the United States, with its vast technological and scientific resources, stumbled so badly in the face of an emerging virus. They’ll wonder why the country responded so slowly, and why, in particular, it lacked adequate diagnostic tests for months after cases started to rise.

But they will also be baffled at something else: that it took so long to study new medicines to determine if they worked — even as the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was killing 2,000 Americans a day.
Simply put, more people will die from Covid-19 because we cannot study drugs more quickly.

This does not mean that it would be better to provide people with unproven therapies — or that Covid-19 studies should be accelerated so fast that we draw the wrong conclusions or put people at risk. But our inability to start and run clinical trials faster — whether in normal times or in a pandemic — is a legacy of our decision not to develop the technologies and approaches that would make doing so easier.
The gold standard method of testing drugs is what is known as a randomized controlled trial, in which patients receive either an experimental drug researchers think will work or the standard care that is already available — a selection that is based, effectively, on a coin flip. Ideally, the trial is also double-blind, which means that patients who don’t get the drug get a placebo, and neither the patients nor their doctors know who got what.

Obviously, for the patients who receive a placebo, this can be a sacrifice. And it can be a hard one to make. 
But researchers have learned the hard way that this is often the only way to figure out if a treatment works. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have put a stop to routine mastectomies in breast cancer, the belief that common arrhythmia drugs saved lives, and a common knee surgery that was no better than physical therapy. A decade ago, Pfizer spent more than a billion dollars developing a heart drug that an RCT showed resulted in more patients dying.
So many experts see randomized controlled trials as critical at this time. 
“I just don’t understand why you would do a trial that’s not randomized,” said Ethan J. Weiss, an associate professor of cardiology at the University of California, San Francisco. “We have an incredible opportunity to do real trials in real endpoints in a record amount of time.”

But the process of designing and conducting studies takes time, and it’s even harder when the health care system is under siege from a surge of Covid-19 cases. 
Heroically, lots of studies are getting done in the face of Covid-19, and researchers are using innovative methods to do them, allowing studies to be modified quickly to include new treatments. The U.K.’s RECOVERY trial is testing treatments including hydroxychloroquine and a pair of HIV drugs. The most rigorous study of Gilead’s experimental Covid-19 drug, remdesivir, is a trial being conducted by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases. The World Health Organization is running a study that includes both remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine, among other drugs. The U.S. government’s Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute is running a study to see if hydroxychloroquine prevents doctors from getting Covid-19.

But both remdesivir and chloroquine were identified as potentially active against SARS-CoV-2 in laboratory tests in February, and we still don’t know for sure if they work against the virus in people. Gilead should release some data on remdesivir this month in patients with severe disease, though that study compares two courses of remdesivir, not a control group. 
Part of the problem is technology. Electronic health record software in the U.S. is not set up to make clinical research faster and easier, Raj Mehta, a family medicine researcher at Florida Hospital Family Medicine Residency, wrote in an email. There is historical patient data, there are partnerships to use “big data” with machine learning and artificial intelligence. But all that offers little at the present time.
“We have billing claims as, absurdly, our only reliable and easily integratable national source of raw patient data,” Mehta wrote. “What we don’t have is anything useful to produce evidence-based medicine.
“The criticism may seem harsh, but if we could trade all the data silos, all the AI/ML efforts, & all the billing data, for a fully integrated, nationwide, RCT platform in EHRs, we would *all* do it in a heartbeat,” he said.
One reform packaged in a 2016 law that made changes to the Food and Drug Administration was “to push for randomized trials to answer questions quickly using electronic health records and claims data,” said Robert Califf, the former FDA commissioner who now heads clinical policy and strategy at Verily Life Sciences and Google Health. It’s still needed, he said.
“All you have to do is look at hydroxychloroquine, where you have all these observational studies that cannot possibly answer the question,” Califf said.
For years, there’s been talk about making the clinical trial process more standardized, and cheaper, so that the same rules would apply each time a study needed to be run. There’s even been discussion that what are known as pragmatic trials — large, simple, randomized studies in which less data are collected — might be conducted using electronic health records. But that hasn’t happened at the pace it should.
The reason involves another part of the problem. Clinical trials are principally run by drug and medical device companies in order to obtain regulatory approvals, with public health authorities only picking up the slack in rare examples. But the result is that we have not built a system that would make studies simpler; most patients have little opportunity to participate in research; and we are too slow to figure out what works.
What would the system look like if we fixed it? It would make it easier to study drugs for heart disease, where studies are so large and expensive that many companies don’t test their medicines. It would ease studies for rare cancers, which are currently problematic because the right patients are hard to find. And it could create a medical information superhighway that would power health care through the next century.
It would certainly help with the next pandemic.

4.22.2020,US could see a higher summer death toll and CDC warns of a possibly worse coronavirus outbreak in winter,"

CDC director says possible second wave could be worse 02:52
(CNN) — A leading US model has upped its projected coronavirus death toll in August to 66,000 -- a 10% increase from its previous prediction.
The change came as states began updating their number of deaths, adding residents of nursing homes who officials are now counting as presumptive positives, Dr. Chris Murray, the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, said Tuesday.
But as those numbers grow higher and paint the pandemic as larger than previously thought, Murray said the dates of when social distancing measures can be relaxed should also be moved down.
He said his team of experts were taken aback when states like Georgia -- which still has a high number of infections -- announced they'll be easing some restrictions. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has said he expects an uptick in cases as many stores begin to reopen in the state this Friday, but said the state is prepared to handle them.

""The risk is very great for resurgence from these early openings.""
That's as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director gave an ominous forecast of a possible second wave of the virus in the winter.

4.22.2020,Coronavirus vaccine human trials: How they work and how to volunteer,"The professor behind one of the UK's first human trials for a coronavirus vaccine told Nick Ferrari how it will work and when a vaccine will be available.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced yesterday that the first human trials of coronavirus vaccine from Oxford University and Imperial College will start on Thursday.
Researchers are trialling the two vaccines against Covid-19 in the hope of bringing them forward to manufacturing as soon as possible.
Nick Ferrari spoke to Dr Katrina Pollock, the principal investigator for the COVID-19 vaccine trials at Imperial College London, to find out exactly what's going to happen with the trials.
What is being trialled?
""This is the start of the first of the clinical trials in the UK. This is the beginning of testing one of two candidate vaccines in human trials.
""Work on the vaccine started very early in the year. Within the first couple of weeks of January, scientists were able to sequence the virus in China, which means that we were able to understand it very quickly.
""From that moment on, work to create a candidate vaccine moved forward at great pace.""
Nick Ferrari spoke to the professor behind a new coronavirus vaccine trial

How can you volunteer for the coronavirus vaccine trial?
""There are a number of criteria that people need to fulfil to be eligible to be involved in this early stage vaccine trial. They are usually quite strict so we can see understand the vaccine is performing.
""As we understand the vaccine and the responses, then we move to larger phase two or phase three trials where we include more people. Ultimately, what we want is a vaccine that is going to protect people from this infection, especially the vulnerable and the elderly.""
Who can volunteer for the vaccine trial?
The participants they are looking for need to be:
- adults aged 18-55
- in good health
- have not tested positive for Covid-19
- is not pregnant
- has not taken part in previous adenoviral vaccine trials
This is a multi-site trial, which means that if you want to volunteer, you will need to live near one of the centres, which include Bristol, Southampton, Thames Valley and Greater London.
How long will vaccine trials last?
""These early trials will last up to one year. But the early part of the trials, we'll get data coming through all the time.
""It's normal for us to follow up with volunteers who have been in the trial for quite a long time afterwards, but that doesn't mean we won't get data coming through right from the beginning.""

When will a vaccine be available to the public?
""I'd like to say as soon as possible - there is a great need for this vaccine.
""We're looking at a timescale of months while we trial this vaccine. As we come towards the end of this first trial of the vaccine, we'll be able to say far more clearly when that's going to be.
""We're pushing ahead really quickly so we have some answers on how these vaccines are behaving by the autumn.
""Having a product available by the autumn will be ambitious. We will know more after we start these first trials.""
Will they be able to manufacture enough of the vaccine?
Scaling up manufacturing and distribution are going to be key questions when we have those vaccine candidates available.
""As well as trialling these two vaccines in the UK, we have to look at how they are going to be manufactured and distributed and also at what cost. That is part of this work.
""There is a global effort to deliver it, so I would be confident we can do this when the time comes.""

4.22.2020,"Over-50s – especially Britons who are overweight – should stay at home during the coronavirus crisis to protect the NHS, expert claims as scientists argue over-60s should be included in Government’s total isolation guidance","Over-50s – especially Britons who are overweight – should stay at home during the coronavirus crisis to protect the NHS, an expert has claimed.
Mike Fischer CBE, who runs a medical research lab in Oxford, warned those in the actions of those in their 50s and beyond will be 'critical' for the NHS.
Official data shows more than 54 per cent of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital are aged between 50 to 69 years. 
Almost three quarters of critically ill people are either overweight or obese. 
It comes as scientists argue people in their 60s should be included in Government’s total isolation guidance because they are at an increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness or death.  
They point to data from countries such as China and Italy that show those in their 60s are at high risk of complications and death from the novel coronavirus.
This risk is lower compared with those aged 70 years or older, however.
Current Government guidance suggests those aged 70 or older should be more rigorous in following social distancing measures.
The guidance also applies to those under 70 who have underlying health conditions or a weakened immune system.
Official data shows more than 41 per cent of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital are aged between 50 to 69 years. A total of 17 per cent are 70 years and over	+5

Mr Fischer, who runs Systems Biology Laboratory in Abingdon, told BBC Radio 4: ‘I think the message hasn’t really gone out that the numbers show that the 50 to 60s have as much reason to be diligent and disciplined and make sacrifices to isolate themselves as the over-70s. 
'Over half of the people admitted to critical care in Britain are in the 50 to 69 category. More than twice as many as been admitted to critical care in the over 70.

‘So if you want to reduce the load on NHS beds in a few weeks’ time, the actions of the 50-69s are the critical factor.
‘I think it would be a wise personal choice. And also given the fact that of the people who have left critical care in that age group, 51 per cent have died. 
IS BEING OVERWEIGHT A RISK FACTOR FOR COVID-19? 
Intensive Care National Audit & Research Centre (ICNARC) data has shown three-quarters of critically ill UK COVID-19 patients were overweight or obese.
Similarly, a study of 4,103 seriously ill Covid-19 patients by New York University, showed while age is the biggest single risk factor for serious illness, obesity is a close second.
With around two-thirds of British adults overweight or obese, Dr Matt Capehorn, clinical manager of the Rotherham Institute for Obesity, a specialist centre for weight management, suggests officials should be alerting the public to this.
‘We have daily health briefings on TV — if they said something along these lines and even if half the population took that on board, it would make a difference,’ he says. 
Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist and professor of mathematical biology at Imperial College London also advised people to take responsibility for their own health: ‘We need to assess our risks from a personal perspective, including getting fit and losing weight,’ he said.
Rob Andrews, an associate professor of diabetes and endocrinology at Exeter University, told Good Health that a small weight gain during the lockdown would make limited difference.
But he warned: ‘For future health we would recommend these individuals don’t gain more weight and that they take regular exercise.
‘As your weight goes up there is less ventilation of the lungs and more risk of lung disease — in particular asthma, and increased risk of heart disease and diabetes.'
When it comes to treatment, overweight people ‘have more difficulty getting enough oxygen because of the weight of extra fat on their airways and are more likely to require extra help breathing with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or mechanical ventilation’, Dr Capehorn told Good Health.  
'So you’re not just protecting the NHS, you’re also protecting yourself.'
The average age of critically ill COVID-19 patients in the UK is 60, data from the first reported 5,578 patients shows.
Some 19 per cent were men in their 50s, and 7.8 were women in their 50s. Men account for more COVID-19 patients overall.
More than 22 per cent and eight per cent were men and women aged between 60-69 years, respectively, according to the report from ICNARC which collects data from England, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Asked if those in critical care tend to have underlying health conditions, Mr Fischer said: 'They do. But that’s not that different to the population in general. 
'It is also true that most of the people in critical care are somewhat overweight but that’s not that different to the population in general. So yes, if you are overweight and have underlying health condition it is even more important. 
According to the ICNARC report, people of a healthy weight make up a minority of critically ill COVID-19 patients.
Almost three quarters (74 per cent) are carrying extra weight.
Some 35 per cent have a BMI between 25 and 30, which is regarded as 'overweight' by the NHS, 31 per cent are obese, and just over seven per cent are severely obese.
For comparison, in the general population of England, 64.3 per cent of adults are either overweight (35.6 per cent) or obese (28.7 per cent), Government data from 2019 shows.  
Mr Fischer is in the midst of establishing a network of labs in the hopes of dramatically increase coronavirus testing, and donated £1,000,000 of his own money to do so. 
His comments come as scientists publish an article today, in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, that argued over 60s should be shielded from society. 
Professor Azeem Majeed, head of the department of primary care and public health at Imperial College London, said: 'The UK's policy is at variance with the World Health Organisation, which states that those above the age of 60 years are at the highest risk, requiring additional preventative measures.'

He added: 'To reduce hospitalisations, intensive care admissions and death we recommend that those aged between 60 and 69 are particularly stringent when implementing public health measures such as social distancing and personal hygiene.'
Examples of these measures include avoiding face-to-face contact with family and friends as much as possible, and using telephone or online services to contact their GP or other essential services.
The lockdown imposed by the Government means everyone regardless of their age or health conditions is expected to follow the guidance on social distancing.
But experts suggest the 7.3million people aged between 60 and 69 are at an increased risk of severe illness and death and therefore should be extra stringent in following guidelines.
People under 70 can still undertake activities like going to work and grocery shopping, Professor Majeed, who co-authored the article with colleagues from University of Exeter, said.
He said case fatality rates for those aged 60-69 are 3.5 per cent in Italy and 3.6 per cent in China.
Other countries, including Switzerland and France, have encouraged those aged 65 and older to follow strict public health measures, the authors added.
Commenting on the article, Dr James Gill, an honorary clinical lecturer at Warwick Medical School and locum GP, said one of the benefits of extending the isolation to those aged 60 and above is that it would lead to a further reduction in pressure on the NHS's intensive care unit resources.
He added: 'The risk of mortality from COVID-19 in the 60-69 years age group remains substantial, compared to younger members of the population, however it must be acknowledged people in their 60th decade have a mortality risk six times lower than those 70 years and older.
'Thus whilst it may be reasonable to question whether measures should be extended to those in the 60-70 years group, this should not cause significant concern for those people.'
Responding to the article, Dr Nick Phin, deputy director of National Infection Service at Public Health England, said: 'England data shows that the groups most likely to die from Covid-19 are men and those over the age of 70.
'Sadly, two thirds of deaths have been in men and 79 per cent of all deaths are among those aged 70 and over.'",https://archive.vn/m7C4u#selection-1157.0-1775.110

4.22.2020,Europe's Banks Brace for Bad Debt Build Up From Coronavirus Crisis,"LONDON/MILAN/MADRID — Europe's banks are expected to have to set aside billions for potential loan losses as well as take profit hits because of the coronavirus crisis when they start reporting results over the next two weeks.
The region's banks were already under pressure before the crisis with high costs, low returns, and demands to fix outdated technology. Mergers, which could potentially relieve those issues, have been difficult to pull off because of national barriers.
The largest U.S. banks, which reported earnings last week, set aside $25 billion for credit losses in the first quarter, raising questions about whether European banks would follow suit.
On Wednesday, Italy's UniCredit became the first major euro zone bank to write down the value of its loans to reflect the economic impact of the new coronavirus.
Italy's biggest bank by assets said it would book around 900 million euros ($976 million) in additional loan loss provisions in the first quarter.
Analysts over the past 30 days have revised upward by almost 130% their expectations for loan loss provisions in 2020 by Europe's most important banks, according to a Reuters analysis of data from Refinitiv.

At the same time, analysts have cut by more than 40% their full-year profit forecasts for those banks, which include global banks like HSBC, BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank, the data showed.
Regulators have said they will be lenient in enforcing accounting rules on expected loan losses, but there is pressure on European banks to be realistic about the looming downturn. Lower profitability than their Wall Street rivals will mean European banks have less room for maneuver.
""Those U.S. banks make huge amounts of money,"" said Rob Smith, financial services partner at KPMG.
""European banks don't have that luxury of revenue and income to absorb such significant increases"" in loan loss provisions, he said. ""That in turn that will dictate their approach.""
Though banks are not legally obliged to come up with the bulk of provisions now, ""prudence is a recommendation that should be followed"" given the current environment, a person with knowledge of the matter said.
The vulnerability of European banks to the outbreak was highlighted this week by the credit rating agency Fitch, which disclosed that it had taken 116 rating actions on Western European banks, mainly revising their outlook to negative.
EARNINGS SEASON
The flood of European bank earnings will provide only a partial snapshot of how they are faring so far during the crisis, which began in earnest as the first quarter was well underway. Credit ratings agency S&P said management disclosures and comments would be ""more revealing than the results themselves.""
Italian banks, which have worked hard to tackle the legacy of previous recessions, are expected to start raising provisions against loan losses in the first quarter as the economy heads for a contraction which the International Monetary Fund estimates could reach 9.1% this year, analysts say.
Italy's banks have the highest exposure among European lenders to small- and medium-sized businesses, which are likely to suffer the most from a prolonged lockdown as the country battles with one of the world’s deadliest coronavirus outbreaks.
Morgan Stanley estimated the crisis risks saddling Italian banks with up to an additional 60 billion to 80 billion euros($86.86 billion) in impaired loans over the next two-to-three years, an up to 45% increase on the current stock.
Spain's banks will also report an increase in provisions, said Nuria Alvarez, analyst at Madrid-based brokerage Renta 4.

Santander said earlier this month in a U.S. regulatory filing the pandemic may cause ""us to experience higher credit losses"" there.
Analysts said that a near standstill in Spain's economy would first have a direct impact on the banks' mortgage books, which account for around 40% of their credit portfolios, and on their consumer books, which make up for 8% of lending.
The Bank of Spain said on Monday that the country's tourism- dependent economy could shrink as much as 12.4% this year if the coronavirus lockdown lasts 12 weeks.
At French banks, any higher loan loss provisions are expected to be ""manageable"", Jon Peace, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said.
Deutsche Bank is the only major European lender that analysts forecast to post a loss for the full year of 2020 as it goes through a costly restructuring. The crisis has made it difficult for the bank to predict whether it will meet its financial targets after years of losses.
Analysts as of last week had nearly doubled their expectations for Deutsche Bank's first-quarter and full-year provisions for credit losses compared with early March, according to consensus forecasts published on the bank's website.
Moody's has highlighted that Deutsche Bank is among the global Europe-based investment banks that is most vulnerable to loan-loss charges.
Credit Suisse will kick off the earnings season on Thursday.

E' il piano di Bruno Covas, sindaco di San Paolo, la città più grande e popolosa del Brasile. Nel cimitero di Vila Formosa, il più importante della metropoli, sono state scavate centinaia di fosse per far fronte all'aumento dei morti. Stesso scenario anche a Manaus, in Amazzonia.
""La questione della sepoltura è una sfida, vogliamo essere preparati in modo che le persone abbiano una tomba decente"", ha aggiunto il primo cittadino. Secondo i media brasiliani, la metà delle sepolture a San Paolo riguarda persone decedute a causa del Covid-19. La metropoli è la città più colpita dalla pandemia in Brasile.
 
Le fosse comuni a Manaus sono state annunciate in lacrime dal sindaco di Manaus, Arthur Virgilio Neto: ""Non stiamo vivendo un'emergenza, ma una calamità naturale"". La capitale amazzonica registra centinaia e centinaia di contagiati, con i pochi posti di terapia intensiva ormai al completo.
 
""Siamo al collasso, i medici devono scegliere chi salvare in base all'età, siamo alla barbarie"", ha detto Virgilio, che ha lanciato un appello al governo di Brasilia. ""L'Amazzonia ha bisogno di aiuto, abbiamo bisogno di volontari, medici, infermieri e apparecchiature"".",https://archive.vn/JsJa2#selection-3989.9-4061.175

4.22.2020,First COVID-19 patient recovers well after administration of plasma therapy in Delhi,"The 49-year-old male patient from Delhi, who had tested positive for coronavirus on 4th April, was admitted at COVID facility at Max Hospital, New Delhi with moderate symptoms of fever and respiratory issues. His condition worsened in the next few days and was put to external oxygen to maintain saturation. He developed pneumonia with Type I respiratory failure and was then put on ventilator support on 8th April.
As the patient showed no improvement in his condition, his family had requested the hospital for the plasma therapy administration on compassionate grounds. It is a first of its kind treatment modality that was used for coronavirus disease in India.
The family members then arranged a donor for extracting plasma. The donor who had recovered from the coronavirus infection 3 weeks ago came forward to donate his plasma cells. He was tested again for COVID-19 and was negative at the time of donation along with other standard tests to rule out other infections.
The critically ill patient was then administered fresh plasma as a treatment modality to standard treatment protocols on the night of 14th April. After receiving this treatment, the patient showed progressive improvement. By the 4th day, he was off the ventilator support on 18th April 18 and has been continued on supplementary oxygen.
The patient has been shifted to a room with continuous monitoring and has started taking oral feed since Sunday. He is the first patient, who was administered plasma therapy at Max Hospital in Saket, and has shown positive results.
Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, Group Medical Director, Max Healthcare and Senior Director, Institute of Internal Medicine, said that they are delighted that the plasma therapy worked very well in his case that has open a new treatment opportunity in these pandemic. Other standard treatment protocols were followed during the patients treatment at Max Hospital.
He also said that in a country like India, such treatment has a good potential to help COVID-19 patients, who have moderate to severe disease severity. The government regulations should make such therapy more accessible for hospitals. One donor can donate 400 ml of plasma as it can save two lives. 200 ml is sufficient to treat one COVID-19 patient.
